# face-depth-3D-reconstruction
This is the repository for the face depth regressor implementation. Given a single-view input image, the neural network regressor, predicts dense  depth pixel values, and achieves 3D reconstruction of the entire face. The model is trained on  synthetic EG3D generated data.
